    "# Anomaly Detection with the T-Digest\n",
    "\n",
    "The [t-digest](https://github.com/tdunning/t-digest) is a compact data structure for summarizing observed cumulative probability distributions. Like many data sketching structures, it is incremental, scalable, and parallel (although the implementation in this notebook is not parallel).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores using T-Digests as an anomaly detection structure. T-Digests sketch a Cumulative Distribution Function, and so they can be used to generate anomaly scores using a CDF as we did for Gaussian data in the previous notebook. However, T-Digests will accurately sketch distributions of any shape, which makes them a very flexible anomaly detection tool."
